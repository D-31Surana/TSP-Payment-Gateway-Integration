        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">We are dedicated to provide nutritious meals to children, and also focuses on rural development and community involvement.Our organization provides quality education, healthcare, and skill development to underprivileged children and their families.
          Poor nutrition and hunger is responsible for the death of 3.1 million children a year. That's nearly half of all deaths in children under the age of 5. The children die because their bodies lack basic nutrients. Globally, 822 million people suffer from undernourishment. When you donate to effective children’s charities, you’re creating a world where all kids survive and thrive.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Many people who donate to charity believe it's important to help people in need. We work for social upliftment of the society; starting from health, education, poverty eradication, etc. Opting to support national and international charities comes with distinct advantages. Primarily, it opens up a plethora of meaningful causes to choose from. While local opportunities may be limited, larger organizations provide the chance to engage in impactful initiatives like sponsoring a child or contributing to wildlife conservation efforts.
